# Project: Smile School - Custom Website from Scratch

This project involves building a fully responsive, custom-designed website for "Smile School" using only HTML and CSS. The design is based on a professional designer file provided on Figma.

## Description

The primary goal is to translate a Figma design into a pixel-perfect, functional webpage. This project is split into two main parts:
1.  **HTML, advanced:** Structuring the entire page with clean, semantic HTML5.
2.  **CSS, advanced:** Applying advanced CSS techniques to style the page, ensuring it is responsive and matches the design mockups.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I will demonstrate an understanding of:
- Creating a clean and organized HTML structure based on a design.
- Using semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.
- Applying advanced CSS for layout, including Flexbox.
- Implementing responsive design using media queries.
- Using CSS variables for a maintainable and consistent color scheme.
- Adding custom fonts and styling text elements.
- Creating interactive elements with hover effects and transitions.
