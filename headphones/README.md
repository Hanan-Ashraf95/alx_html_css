Project: Headphones - Responsive Homepage from Scratch
This project is a challenge to build a pixel-perfect, fully responsive homepage for a "Headphones" brand, based on a professional designer file from Figma. The entire project will be implemented from scratch using only HTML and CSS, without the aid of any external libraries or JavaScript.

Project Overview
The main goal is to demonstrate a strong understanding of core front-end technologies by translating a high-fidelity design into a functional, accessible, and responsive webpage. This involves careful analysis of the design, semantic HTML structuring, and precise CSS styling.

Learning Objectives
Build a complete webpage from a designer mockup.

Write clean, semantic, and W3C-compliant HTML5.

Use advanced CSS for layout, positioning, and styling.

Implement responsive design principles using media queries.

Ensure the webpage is accessible to all users.

Manage a project with organized file structure and assets.

Technical Requirements
No JavaScript: The entire page must be functional without any client-side scripting.

No External Frameworks: No Bootstrap, Tailwind, or any other CSS framework is permitted.

Responsive Breakpoint: The layout must switch to a mobile-friendly version at a screen width of 480px or less.

Max Content Width: The main content of the page should not exceed 1000px in width and must be centered on the page.

Hover/Active States:

Links must change color to #FF6565 on hover and active states.

Buttons must change opacity to 0.9 on hover and active states.

Custom Fonts: The project uses 'Source Sans Pro' and 'Spin Cycle OT'. These will need to be properly integrated.
